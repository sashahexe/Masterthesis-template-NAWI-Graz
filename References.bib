	abstract = {The emerging technique of direct laser writing carbonization (DLWc) of polymers, such as polyimide, receives great attention for its flexibility, versatility, and ease-of-patterning capability in creating a variety of functional materials and devices. To fully take advantage of this novel method for consistently fabricating different types of functional devices, it is necessary to understand the complicated photo-thermal conversion and heat transfer process involved in DLWc. In the present study, we focus on the carbonized dot features created by DLWc on a polyimide substrate to address this issue and investigate its implications on the related processing-structure relationships. Both experimental and theoretical results reveal that the laser power, irradiation duration and the extent-of-focus all have significant effect to dictate the size, morphology and porous structures of the carbonized features created by DLWc. The Gaussian beam characteristics of the laser source used in DLWc is responsible for the highly localized and non-uniformly distributed heating source density that causes the finally formed carbon structures with strong composition/morphology gradients. The no-free-parameter photo-thermal model and its FEA implementation presented in our study offer a platform for better understanding, controlling and optimizing the complicated but highly promising DLWc technique.},

abstract = {Abstract Laser-induced graphene (LIG) is a 3D porous material prepared by direct laser writing with a CO2 laser on carbon materials in ambient atmosphere. This technique combines 3D graphene preparation and patterning into a single step without the need for wet chemical steps. Since its discovery in 2014, LIG has attracted broad research interest, with several papers being published per month using this approach. These serve to delineate the mechanism of the LIG-forming process and to showcase the translation into many application areas. Herein, the strategies that have been developed to synthesize LIG are summarized, including the control of LIG properties such as porosity, composition, and surface characteristics, and the advancement in methodology to convert diverse carbon precursors into LIG. Taking advantage of the LIG properties, the applications of LIG in broad fields, such as microfluidics, sensors, and electrocatalysts, are highlighted. Finally, future development in biodegradable and biocompatible materials is briefly discussed.},

To accurately measure these parameters, a variety of methods have been proposed and are used in academia and industry. As a result, some confusion has been caused due to the inconsistencies between different evaluation methods and practices. Such confusion hinders effective communication of new research findings, and creates a hurdle in transferring novel supercapacitor technologies from research labs to commercial applications. Based on public sources, this article is an attempt to inventory, critique and hopefully streamline the commonly used instruments, key performance metrics, calculation methods, and major affecting factors for supercapacitor performance evaluation. Thereafter the primary sources of inconsistencies are identified and possible solutions are suggested, with emphasis on device performance vs. material properties and the rate dependency of supercapacitors. We hope, by using reliable, intrinsic, and comparable parameters produced, the existing inconsistencies and confusion can be largely eliminated so as to facilitate further progress in the field.},

Here we study the parameters required for the formation of varied laser-induced graphene (LIG) morphologies by tuning the laser radiation energy. It was found that a critical fluence point of ∼5 J/cm2 is needed to initiate the carbonization process regardless of the laser power. When increasing the radiation energy, the physical formation of LIG follows a fluid dynamics process in that the morphology of the LIG progressively changes from sheets to fibers and finally to droplets. We then demonstrate that a morphology of LIG nanomaterial, LIG fibers (LIGF), can be generated by this one-step laser photothermolysis process at a radiation energy {\textgreater}40 J/cm2. The LIGF are hollow with a LIG wall and form vertically aligned fibers up to 1 mm in height. Microsupercapacitor (MSC) devices fabricated from LIGF and LIGF-LIG hybrids show 2× the specific areal capacitance over MSCs made entirely from LIG, thereby underscoring the potential for LIGF in flexible device applications.},

abstract = "The electrical conductivity of different carbon materials (multi-walled carbon nanotubes, graphene, carbon black and graphite), widely used as fillers in polymeric matrices, was studied using compacts produced by a paper preparation process and by powder compression. Powder pressing assays show that the bulk conductivity depends not only on the intrinsic material properties but is also strongly affected by the number of particle contacts and the packing density. Conductivities at high pressure (5MPa) for the graphene, nanotube and carbon black show lower values (~102S/m) as compared to graphite (~103S/m). For nanotube, graphene and graphite particles, the conductive behavior during compaction is governed by mechanical particle arrangement/deformation mechanisms while for carbon black this behavior is mainly governed by the increasing particle contact area. The materials resulting from the paper preparation process for carbon black and graphite showed similar conductivity values as for the compacts, indicating a limited effect of the surfactant on the conductivity. The paper preparation process for the large surface area nanotube and graphene particles induces a highly preferred in-plane orientation, thereby yielding largely the single particle intrinsic conductivity for the in-plane direction, with values in the order of 103S/m."

	abstract = {The electrical conductivity of different carbon materials (multi-walled carbon nanotubes, graphene, carbon black and graphite), widely used as fillers in polymeric matrices, was studied using compacts produced by a paper preparation process and by powder compression. Powder pressing assays show that the bulk conductivity depends not only on the intrinsic material properties but is also strongly affected by the number of particle contacts and the packing density. Conductivities at high pressure (5MPa) for the graphene, nanotube and carbon black show lower values ({\textasciitilde}102S/m) as compared to graphite ({\textasciitilde}103S/m). For nanotube, graphene and graphite particles, the conductive behavior during compaction is governed by mechanical particle arrangement/deformation mechanisms while for carbon black this behavior is mainly governed by the increasing particle contact area. The materials resulting from the paper preparation process for carbon black and graphite showed similar conductivity values as for the compacts, indicating a limited effect of the surfactant on the conductivity. The paper preparation process for the large surface area nanotube and graphene particles induces a highly preferred in-plane orientation, thereby yielding largely the single particle intrinsic conductivity for the in-plane direction, with values in the order of 103S/m.},

abstract = "The previous experimental study illustrated that a direct laser scribing on polyimide (PI) induced layered graphene, which opened a new door of producing graphene associated materials. However, the underlying conversion mechanism is unknown, especially from theoretical perspectives. In this paper, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of this mechanism under extreme conditions of high pressure and temperature which mimic those generated by laser induction. We investigated this process using the ReaxFF potential in a nanosecond time scale. We found out that at a pressure of ∼3 GPa and temperature of >2400 K generated from NVT processes, layered graphene clusters were crystallized from PI without metal catalysts, which is consistent with previous experimental results. However, if simulated under NPT processes with a pressure of 27 MPa, the PI was decomposed into small molecules, and no graphene layers were observed. Furthermore, by analyzing the number of the carbon rings and the pair distribution function of them we quantified the crystallinity of the graphene clusters. Through tracing the emission of the small molecules such as H2O, N2, H2, CO we propose possible reaction paths for both of the NVT and NPT processes."

Here we study the parameters required for the formation of varied laser-induced graphene (LIG) morphologies by tuning the laser radiation energy. It was found that a critical fluence point of ∼5 J/cm2 is needed to initiate the carbonization process regardless of the laser power. When increasing the radiation energy, the physical formation of LIG follows a fluid dynamics process in that the morphology of the LIG progressively changes from sheets to fibers and finally to droplets. We then demonstrate that a morphology of LIG nanomaterial, LIG fibers (LIGF), can be generated by this one-step laser photothermolysis process at a radiation energy >40 J/cm2. The LIGF are hollow with a LIG wall and form vertically aligned fibers up to 1 mm in height. Microsupercapacitor (MSC) devices fabricated from LIGF and LIGF-LIG hybrids show 2× the specific areal capacitance over MSCs made entirely from LIG, thereby underscoring the potential for LIGF in flexible device applications."

abstract = {Abstract Laser-induced graphene (LIG) is a 3D porous material prepared by direct laser writing with a CO2 laser on carbon materials in ambient atmosphere. This technique combines 3D graphene preparation and patterning into a single step without the need for wet chemical steps. Since its discovery in 2014, LIG has attracted broad research interest, with several papers being published per month using this approach. These serve to delineate the mechanism of the LIG-forming process and to showcase the translation into many application areas. Herein, the strategies that have been developed to synthesize LIG are summarized, including the control of LIG properties such as porosity, composition, and surface characteristics, and the advancement in methodology to convert diverse carbon precursors into LIG. Taking advantage of the LIG properties, the applications of LIG in broad fields, such as microfluidics, sensors, and electrocatalysts, are highlighted. Finally, future development in biodegradable and biocompatible materials is briefly discussed.},

These systems displayed elevated thermal and hardness properties at an increased cross-link density. Furthermore, the level of crystallinity was reduced as displayed by XRD analysis. Along with this observation, the calculated fractional free volume (FFV) showed a decreasing trend leading to the ‘densification’ effect. It was envisaged that the linear polysiloxane chain segments aligned parallel to each other in a triclinic crystal system to generate a crystalline domain. The spacing between these stacking chains was found to be about 7.2 Å as measured from simulated XRD pattern.},

These materials were processed by spin coating and subjected to common microfabrication, micromachining, and biomedical processes: chemical immersion, oxygen plasma treatment, sterilization, and exposure to tissue culture media. The PDMS formulations were analyzed by gravimetry, goniometry, tensile testing, nanoindentation, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Spin coating of PDMS was formulation dependent with film thickness ranging from 308 μm on PDMS1 to 171 μm on PDMS5 at 200 revolutions per minute (rpm). Ultimate tensile stress (UTS) increased from 3.9 MPa (PDMS1) to 10.8 MPa (PDMS3), and then decreased down to 4.0 MPa (PDMS5). Autoclave sterilization (AS) increased the storage modulus (σ) and UTS in all formulations, with the highest increase in UTS exhibited by PDMS5 (218\%). PDMS surface hydrophilicity and micro-textures were generally unaffected when exposed to the different chemicals, except for micro-texture changes after immersion in potassium hydroxide and buffered hydrofluoric, nitric, sulfuric, and hydrofluoric acids; and minimal changes in contact angle after immersion in hexane, hydrochloric acid, photoresist developer, and toluene. Oxygen plasma treatment decreased the contact angle of PDMS2 from 109∘ to 60∘. Exposure to tissue culture media resulted in increased PDMS surface element concentrations of nitrogen and oxygen.},

It was shown that PDMS thermally decomposes to cyclic oligomers through Si–O bond scission in a chain-folded cyclic conformation energetically favored by overlapping of empty silicon d-orbitals with orbitals of oxygen and carbon atoms. Kinetic treatment shows that PDMS thermal volatilization, as rate of heating increases, becomes dominated by rate of diffusion and evaporation of oligomers produced on its decomposition. At high heating rate (e.g. 100°Cmin−1.) thermal decomposition in nitrogen and in air tend to overlap because the rate of reaction between the material and oxygen is strongly reduced by low-oxygen solubility and high-thermal degradation rate. In nitrogen a small black residue is formed (silicon oxycarbide) which is produced by an alternative decomposition path leading to cyclic oligomers, made possible at high heating rate.},

To immobilize cell-adhesive molecules to the otherwise non-adhesive PDMS substrate, hydrophobic, electrostatic and covalent surface coating procedures have been developed. The efficacy of different coating strategies to transmit stretches to cells however is poorly documented and has not been compared. We describe a novel and simple procedure to covalently bind extracellular matrix proteins to the surface of stretchable PDMS membranes. The method comprises PDMS oxygenation, silanization, and covalent protein cross-linking to the silane. We demonstrate improved attachment (∼2-fold), spreading (∼2.5-fold) and proliferation (∼1.2-fold) of fibroblasts to our new coating over established coating procedures. Further, we compared the efficiency of different PDMS coating techniques to transmit stretches. After 15\% stretch, the number of maximally (15 ± 5\%) stretched cells on our PDMS surface coating was ∼7-fold higher compared with alternative coating protocols. Hence, covalent linkage of adhesive molecules is superior to non-covalent methods in providing a coating that resists large deformations and that fully transmit this stretch to cultured cells.},

Some of them (e.g., polyesters) can be biodegradable, and in general, these materials are cost-effective compared to natural polymers. Their main disadvantage is their relatively poor cellular interaction. Therefore, synthetic polymers commonly receive a surface treatment or are combined into a composite material (e.g., with natural polymers) to improve their cellular compatibility. However, research into skin biomaterials solely composed of synthetic polymers continues to be an active area. The aim of this chapter is to provide an overview of the current synthetic polymers used in skin biomaterials. The properties and current state of research for the most commonly used synthetic polymers are discussed and commercially available skin biomaterials made of synthetic polymers are reviewed. The chapter ends with conclusions and future directions on this area of research."

The mechanical and electrical properties of the proposed material can be easily tuned by acting on the polyimide powder concentration. The reported procedure takes advantage from the simple casting process, typical of silicone elastomer, allowing to produce electrodes conformable to any kind of shape and surface as well as complex three-dimensional structures. Electrochemical capacitors and strain gauges are selected as flexible prototypes to demonstrate the multifunctional properties of the obtained LIG on the PDMS/PI composite substrate.},

	abstract = {A laser-induced-graphene (LIG) pattern fabricated using a 355 nm pulsed laser was applied to a strain sensor. Structural analysis and functional evaluation of the LIG strain sensor were performed by Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging, and electrical–mechanical coupled testing. The electrical characteristics of the sensor with respect to laser ﬂuence and focal length were evaluated. The sensor responded sensitively to small deformations, had a high gauge factor of {\textasciitilde}160, and underwent mechanical fracture at 30\% tensile strain. In addition, we have applied the LIG sensor, which has high sensitivity, a simple manufacturing process, and good durability, to human ﬁnger motion monitoring.},
