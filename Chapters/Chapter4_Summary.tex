PDMS + LIG:
Rewrite:
from Lamberti: "We found this process to have some limitations,
both from the preparation and exploitability points of view.
Indeed, PDMS infiltration into the LIG network has a strong
influence on the obtained LIG/PDMS since it requires long
time and vacuum evacuation of trapped bubbles, affecting the
PDMS casting onto curved surfaces and reducing the
conductivity of the starting LIG on PI."
